    Hi, I’m @Sail-Hatan-666
  </head>
  <p>
    Video games, and working is unfortunately my life right now. I recently found a passion for learning, studying, and researching coding,
    with a goal of one day becoming a Full Stacked Web Developer.
    I'm currently learning HTML/CSS, with a goal of starting JS within the next few months. I know this can be an ambitious goal, but i believe
    im ready to make the next step and stay commited to my practice. 8 hours working, 4 hours studying per night.
    After completing JS, I'll focus on a back-end language.. But we'll cross that bridge when we get there!
